# netstat-rust
Cross-platform netstat tool made in Rust.

Just a simple netstat tool that shows all TCP/UDP ports, their states and associated processes.

### Why?
Because the windows netstat tool doesn't show all processes in user mode - and also does not show them in a single line for quick filtering. 

This also displays everything sorted by port and is formatted in a way that suits me.
